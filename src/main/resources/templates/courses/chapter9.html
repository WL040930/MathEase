                <h3>Relationship Between Sides, Vertices, and Diagonals of a Polygon</h3>

                <p>The relationship between the number of sides (n), vertices (V), and diagonals (D) of a polygon is as follows:</p>

                <ol>

                        <br>

                            <li><p>The number of diagonals in a polygon can be calculated using the formula: D = n(n - 3)/2.</p></li>
                            <li><p>This formula applies to simple polygons (convex polygons) where no two sides intersect except at their endpoints.</p></li>

                            <li><p>In any polygon, the number of sides is equal to the number of vertices. Additionally, the number of diagonals can be determined based on the number of sides using the formula mentioned above.</p></li>

                            <li><p>The total number of line segments in a polygon includes both the sides and diagonals. It can be calculated as: Total Line Segments = Sides + Diagonals = n + n(n - 3)/2.</p></li>

                <p><b><u>Question</u></b></p>

                <p>
                    Find the number of vertices and the number of diagonals of a polygon with 10 sides
                </p>

                <div id="9.1Explanation">
                    <p><b><u>Solution</u></b></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Step 1: Understand the Question</strong>
                            <p>The question asks us to determine two things: the number of vertices (corners) and the number of diagonals in a polygon with 10 sides.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Step 2: Finding the Number of Vertices</strong>
                            <p>The number of vertices in any polygon is equal to the number of sides. Since the polygon in question has 10 sides, it also has 10 vertices.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Step 3: Finding the Number of Diagonals</strong>
                            <p>The formula to find the number of diagonals in a polygon is "D = n(n - 3)/2", where "n" is the number of sides.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For a polygon with 10 sides:
                                    <br> D = (10 × (10 - 3)) / 2
                                    <br> D = (10 × 7) / 2
                                    <br> D = 70 / 2
                                    <br> D = 35
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Therefore, the polygon with 10 sides has 10 vertices and 35 diagonals.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Drawing the Polygon:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use a ruler and a pencil to draw the polygon on a piece of paper or a whiteboard.</li>
                    <li>Connect the vertices with straight lines to form the sides of the polygon.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that the sides do not intersect within the polygon.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Labeling the Vertices:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify each vertex of the polygon.</li>
                    <li>Label the vertices with capital letters (e.g., A, B, C, ...) in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.</li>
                    <li>Start labeling from any vertex and proceed sequentially around the polygon.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Naming the Polygon:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Determine the type of polygon based on the number of sides.</li>
                    <li>Use the appropriate polygon name, such as triangle (3 sides), quadrilateral (4 sides), pentagon (5 sides), hexagon (6 sides), etc.</li>
                    <li>If the polygon is a regular polygon (all sides and angles are equal), specify it as a regular polygon (e.g., regular hexagon).</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Optional: Indicating Side Lengths and Angles:</h3>
                <p>If provided with side lengths or angle measures, you can indicate them near the corresponding sides or angles. Use tick marks or numbers to represent measurements accurately.</p>

                <h3>Reviewing the Drawing:</h3>
                <p>Double-check the drawing to ensure accuracy in the shape, labeling, and naming of the polygon. Make any necessary adjustments or corrections.</p>

                <p>
                    What type of triangle has all three angles measuring less than 90 degrees, and what is the relationship between the lengths of its sides?

                <div id="9.2.1Explanation">
                    <p><b><u>Solution</u></b></p>
                    <p>
                        The type of triangle described in the question is an acute triangle. In an acute triangle, all three angles are less than 90 degrees.
                        <br> <br>
                        The relationship between the lengths of the sides in an acute triangle varies. Since acute triangles can have varying side lengths, there is no fixed relationship between the lengths of its sides. However, it is important to note that in any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side, according to the triangle inequality theorem.

                <h3>Properties of a Quadrilateral</h3>

                <p>A quadrilateral is a polygon with the following properties:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Four Sides:</strong> A quadrilateral has four sides.</li>
                    <li><strong>Four Vertices:</strong> It has four vertices where the sides meet, also known as corners.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sum of Interior Angles:</strong> The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.</li>
                    <li><strong>Types of Quadrilaterals:</strong> Square, Rectangle, Rhombus, Parallelogram, Trapezoid, Kite, Quadrilateral.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diagonals:</strong> A quadrilateral has two diagonals, which are line segments connecting opposite vertices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Area:</strong> The area of a quadrilateral can be calculated using various formulas depending on its type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perimeter:</strong> The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of its four sides.</li>
                    <li><strong>Properties of Special Quadrilaterals:</strong> Each type of quadrilateral has its own unique properties.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Interior Angles:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Apply the Sum of Interior Angles Theorem: The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.</li>
                    <li>If given the measures of three interior angles, subtract their sum from 360 degrees to find the measure of the fourth angle.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Exterior Angles:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Apply the Exterior Angle Theorem: The measure of an exterior angle of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the measures of the two interior angles not adjacent to it.</li>
                    <li>If given the measures of interior angles, subtract each angle from 180 degrees to find the measure of the corresponding exterior angle.</li>
